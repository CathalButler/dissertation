Looking back on the project there were definitely some things I would have done differently. I think for the most part the topic chosen for the project was adequately challenging, if not quite difficult, but was not something I found myself really getting into. This, I feel, was attributed to Flutter as a front-end technology. The reason being is that with the time-frame of this project, the other projects for our other modules, and my work-life balance which I was trying to juggle, that it was quite difficult to learn and become fluent in Flutter in the time frame given. This in itself caused blocking issues throughout the duration of the project. Flutter in itself is a decent programming language, but it is not one which I see myself revisiting. In terms of the overall choice of topic and frameworks, I think it could have been scoped with more scrutiny. We had an idea for quite some time but didn’t make up our mind on certain aspects until quite late in the project, which also caused a few headaches. Ultimately though it made for quite a challenging project which was outside the norm of what I may have undertaken should I have been on my own.
\\\\ If I had my time over again, and had to re-do this project, I would have gone solo. The reason being is that should any issues have arisen, they would have been through my own fault and would have been met with more active decision. I also would have gone with a topic that would have been more AI related as I intend to pursue a post-grad in that area. That being said I would like to stress that both of my other 2 team mates were terrific to work with, despite some bumpy roads along the way, and are both exceptionally talented and focused in the work they needed to do. Some deadlines definitely could have been met sooner, but we ultimately got a proof of concept working for WebRTC with Flutter, and although the application is not what it could have been, I’m definitely proud of what we achieved as a team. 
\\\\ Overall I am quite happy with how this project turned out. Despite its short comings it was approached from a very professional manner, and our goal was ultimately hit in the end. I would like to thank our supervisor, John French, for his patience and advice with us along the way, and also like to thank my teammates for pulling together and finalising this piece of work.
