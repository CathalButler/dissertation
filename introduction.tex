\section{Project Introduction}
The purpose of this project was to construct an application which relied on modern day frameworks and technologies. The project was aimed at using these technologies and frameworks to build a self-hosted conference application in which the user could generate their own sessions and chat rooms in order to communicate with others. Intentions to combine these technologies with pre-existing technologies such as WebRTC, or VOIP, to allow the success of the application. During the initial planning stage of this application no team-member had any idea that the relevance of this application would become quite large and necessary due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and a solid conference call application would become heavy relied on for day-to-day work.
\\\\ The aim of this project was to combine a state-of-the-art front-end framework to a reliable and rapid back-end technology which would be connected to a stable and resilient database. The choices which were examined and undertook were the following: Flutter, for the front-end; Flask, for the back-end; MySQL, for the database. A large aim for this project was also to integrate Flutter with WebRTC, which was quite a challenge as Flutter is still quite new and there exist few examples of the correct structure to which the challenge had presented.
