Abstract = {Information technologies give patients the opportunity to communicate with medical professionals remotely. Telemedicine uses these technologies to provide advanced healthcare and medical services. We present a medical online consultation application based on Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) technology enabling chat, audio, and video calls. Communication architecture and protocols of the application are explained in detail. Additionally, the user interface of the application is shown via performed calls. The application is tested and evaluated on different network connections (3G, 4G, local, and DSL) and different browsers and mobile operating systems (Android, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, iOS, Opera, Safari). During calls, communication quality parameters such as round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss, obtained via the WebRTC application programming interface, are analyzed. 3G, 4G, and local connections show low packet losses (<1%). Packet losses are high (>1%) in Android, },

Abstract = {The research presented in this paper introduces Rendez-Vous, which is a system oriented to provide its users with a greater communication availability through the convergence of the conventional telephony and the real-time multimedia on the web browsers. The system consists on a web application that provides a videoconference room for multiple users without having to download any additional software. For the cases in which a user with no internet connection might need to participate in a conference, it is possible to dial and answer phone calls to/from the PSTN directly on the web browser, allowing the telephonic user to interact with the others using his/her voice. The aim of the present project is to propose a unified communications system that differs from others mainly in the interaction with the telephone network directly from a web browser while having an active videoconference, allowing real-time exchange of media streams between these two technologies. The system Rendez-Vous w},

Abstract = {In this paper, we presented issues, challenges, and solutions of videoconference system for rural education. First, we discussed several issues on the implementation of videoconference system for education, particulary in rural area in Indonesia, which covered videoconference requirement, rural condition, and education needs. Second, we presented several challenges consisted of choosing videoconference technology, choosing compression method, system and application development, ensuring quality of services, and ensuring quality of experiences. Based on the issues and challenges, we proposed a solution of videoconference system which is specifically deployed in rural education. The solution was based on WebRTC technology implemented in Intel i5 core miniPC choosen to increase portability of the system. A STUN server was built on Javascript to facilitate communication between each client terminal. A simple and intuitive user interface was designed to facilitate the use of application by},
